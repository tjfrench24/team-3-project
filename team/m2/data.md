# Application Data 

##  Overview

### 1. User Profile

- **Description**: Contains personal information about the user, including their basic physiological data, exercise frequency and goals.
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id` (string): A unique identifier for each user.
  - `name` (string): The user's full name.
  - `email` (string): The user's email address.
  - `password` (string): A hashed version of the user's password.
  - `age` (int) : The user's age
  - `weight` (float) : The user's weight(kg)
  - `height` (float) : The user's height(cm)
  - `exercise_frequency` (string) : The user's exercise frequency(e.g."Hight","Middle","Low")
  - `exercise_capacity` (string) : The user's exercise capacity(e.g."Hight","Middle","Low")
  - `goal` (string) : The user's fitness goals (e.g., building muscle, losing fat, getting in shape)
  - `created_at` (timestamp): The date and time when the account was 
    created.
  - `updated_at` (timestamp): The last time the user's profile was updated.
- **Data Source**: User-input data when registering or updating their profile.

### 2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

- **Description**: Calculates the user's basal metabolic rate, which is used to understand how much energy the user burns each day.
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id` (string): The unique identifier for the user associated with the BMR.
  - `bmr` (float): User's basal metabolic rate (calories burned per day).
  - `exercise_adjusted_bmr` (float): Metabolic rate adjusted for the user's exercise frequency and capacity.
  - `calculation_date` (date): Date of calculation of basal metabolic rate.
- **Data Source**: It is automatically generated by the system based on the user's input of age, weight, height, exercise frequency and exercise capacity.

### 3. Nutritional Intake Recommendations

- **Description**: Recommended daily intake of nutrients based on the user's basal metabolic rate and fitness goals
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id` (string): The unique identifier for the user associated with the Nutritional Intake Recommendations.
  - `recommended_calories` (float): Recommended daily calorie intake.
  - `protein_intake` (float): Recommended daily protein intake (g).
  - `carbohydrate_intake` (float): Recommended daily carbohydrate intake (g).
  - `fiber_intake` (float): Recommended daily fiber intake (g).
  - `fat_intake` (float): Recommended daily fat intake (g).
  - `recommended_foods` (JSON): List of recommended foods and corresponding serving sizes.
  - `calculation_date` (date): Date of calculation of recommended intake.
- **Data Source**: Automatically generated by the system based on the user's basal metabolic rate and fitness goals.

### 4. training program

- **Description**: Personalized workout plans based on the user's fitness goals and exercise ability.
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id` (string): The unique identifier for the user associated with the training program.
  - `goal` (string): The user's fitness goals (e.g., building muscle, losing fat, getting in shape).
  - `exercise_plan` (JSON): Recommended workout plan for the user, including the type, duration, and difficulty of each workout.
  - `current_amount` (float): The amount saved so far.
  - `plan_creation_date` (date): The date by which the user aims to reach the 
    savings goal.
- **Data Source**: Programs generated by the system based on the user's fitness goals, exercise ability and personal preferences.

### 5. Progress tracking

- **Description**: Used to track a user's fitness progress, including weight changes, metabolic rate changes and nutritional intake.
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id` (string): The unique identifier for the user associated with the progress tracking.
  - `weight_progress` (JSON): History of user's weight.
  - `bmr_progress` (JSON): History of user's bmr.
  - `nutrition_progress` (JSON): A history of the user's daily nutritional intake.
  - `progress_date` (date): The date of each record.
- **Data Source**: Automatically recorded by the system based on user input and system-generated data. 

## Data Relationships

- **User to Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**: One-to-one relationship (a user can have one BMR in the meantime).
- **User to Nutritional Intake Recommendations**: One-to-one relationship (a user can have one Nutritional intake recommendations in the meantime).
- **User to training program**: One-to-one relationship (a user can have one training program).
- **User to Progress tracking**: One-to-many relationship(a user can have many progress tracking).

## Data Sources

- **User-Input Data**: Most of the data, including user profiles, goal, weight, height, exercise frequency, and exercise capacity, will come from direct user input via forms in the application.
- **System-Generated Data**: Basal metabolic rate, nutritional intake recommendations and training programs are automatically calculated and generated by the system based on user input.
