# Problem Statement

## Problem Description 

When attempting to reach fitness goals, many people struggle to realize if they are actually making progress. Due to the fact that there are so many various factors that go into how your body develops and changes, it is hard to track each of these aspects of physical fitness and figure out which area you need to improve in. These could include diet, workout plan, exercise type, sleep, etc. This can lead to frustration and a loss of motivation due to a lack of tangible results. While there are applications that can track diet, weight-lifting, and other aspects of fitness, they often fail to synthesize all factors that need to be considered, having one focus, such as an app that specifically tracks a user's diet. In addition, they often don’t provide plans or guides that will help a user reach the goals they set. 

## Proposed Solution 

With the creation of our fitness application, HealthHub, we hope to provide a more well-rounded application that will take into account multiple aspects of physical health. This application will allow users to input their goals. After this input, they will be given plans for diet, exercise regimen, sleep, recovery, as well as a timeline for these plans. Then, over the timeline provided by the application, users will be able to input their eating habits, sleeping habits, exercise completed and statistics on these exercises, and weight gained/lost. This will allow for tracking of progress and determining which of these factors or helping or preventing the user from reaching their goals. 

Key Features: 

- Goal Setting: Users can set their fitness goals, which may include cardiovascular goals, weight gain/loss, or weight-lifting goals. This will also require users to input a baseline fitness profile (explained further as User Data Collection and BMR in features.md). 
- Data Input and Progress Graphs: After goals are set, a user can input their actions regarding each aspect of fitness included in the plan to attain these goals. This can include inputting information about diet/calories taken in for a given day, weight and repetitions for a specific lift, etc. The application will give progress reports in the form of graphs based on these inputs to tell the user if they are making progress toward their goals. 
- Calendar: After goals are set, a plan for a given timeline will be provided to the user to reach their goals in the form of a calendar. This will allow the user to take their fitness journey one day at a time, while still being able to understand the long-term plan. This can include a meal plan, fitness and recovery plan, sleep schedule, recovery time, etc. 
- Feedback: In addition, if a user is not making progress, the app will make additional suggestions to get them on track. 
- Multi-Device Access: The application will be accessible on both mobile and desktop devices. 

We hope that these features will help people track their fitness progress and determine how they can reach their goals. 


## Why This Matters

A person’s physical health is very important. Some people may not know where to start in their fitness journey. Furthermore, in order to determine if you are truly becoming a more physically healthy or fit person, you need some way to track your progress. In addition, if you are not making progress, it is typically hard to determine what is preventing you from doing so. HealthHub attempts to address these problems.
