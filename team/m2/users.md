Primary Audience:
Our web application, HealthHub, has a very broad and inclusive audience. We want to cater to anyone who wants to focus on their fitness, cardiovascular health, and better themselves physically in any way. We are creating a fitness app that is open to all experience levels, no matter what their goals are for themselves. This app is for those who want to keep track of their workouts in an organized fashion. It will also allow them to stay on a path towards their goals with a structured schedule that helps them reach their target. This app is not restricted to any age groups, but encourages anyone who wants to focus on their fitness with an app.

User Needs:
Some people struggle with sticking to a schedule and planning workouts themselves, so they need a tool that can help provide them with a pre-made schedule to adhere to with a timeline for workouts. They need an app that can create easy to follow plans catered to their goals so they can spend time focusing on their busy lives and schedules. 

Young, college-aged people tend to have a lot going on, so having an app that can build in workouts into their schedule is extremely useful. They can continue to navigate their hectic lives without having to dedicate time and effort into coming up with plans to stay fit. 

An app like this would appeal to busy parents who may not have time for the gym, but can implement some simple workouts at home and keep an eye on their children. Finding time to go out to the gym and spending money for a membership is not always an option, but with this app they can figure out how to manage their fitness in simple ways and track their progress. 

For older adults who do not have the same mobility as younger people, it is crucial that they remain active for their own health and independence. Keeping to a steady workout routine can help manage their lives and allows them retain the activeness of their youth. HealthHub will contribute to not only their physical but mental health and quality of life as they grow older.
