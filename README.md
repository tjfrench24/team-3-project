Team 3 repository for milestone 2. 

## Running Instructions: 

As it stands right now, this is how to run the application. 

In the VSCode terminal, do these two things: 

1) npm install
2) npm start in the /team-3-project/
3) open new terminal and run npm start in /backend/
  
This should run an HTTP server and open up a browser window for the application.
